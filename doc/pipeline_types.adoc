= Pipeline Types

Piplines can be categorized into 3 types based on how they interact with
headers.

1. **Read Only**: Packets are not modified and only read to determine how they
   should be processed.

2. **Data Modification**: Header fields are modified as they pass through the
   pipeline.

3. **Structure Modification**: Headers are added, removed or change in size as
   they pass through the pipeline.

Each of these pipline types requires a different type of processing. Read only
pipelines can simply pass packet pointers through the pipeline. Data
modification pipelines can also simply pass packet pointers through the
pipeline as long as they are mutable. Structure modification pipelines require
the machinery described in <<Packet Mapping>>.
